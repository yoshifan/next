This file contains comments about package.json, since there's no particularly clean way to add comments directly in JSON files.

ember-cli-babel
Should be ^6.12.0, but JV generator only works with ^5.1.6 it seems.

ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile
Should be ^1.0.2, but that requires ember-cli-babel 6.7.1 or above.

ember-cli-qunit
Updating this to 4.x.x makes the test runner hang on the first test. We need to port our test code to make the new version work: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-qunit/issues/183

ember-cli-release
Latest release was 2016 June, and the dependency deprecations have piled up. Might want to consider a replacement for this.

ember-computed-decorators
This should be updated to ember-decorators instead, but one of the JV generator tests only works with ember-computed-decorators.

ember-pagefront
Latest release was 2016 August. It also gets this command line error when doing `yarn run start`: `Cannot find module 'ember-cli/lib/ext/promise'`. So this package has been removed from dependencies. No replacement for its functionality so far.
